# Recursion Problem Sets 👨🏽‍💻
The following challenges are designed to test your understanding of recursion and feature in many exams and programming interviews.

## Challenge 1 - Countdown ⚔️
Write a function that counts down from a certain number `n` to `0`. 
- Instead of using a loop like a ``for`` or ``while`` loop, you must use **recursion.**
- Prompt the user to enter a number at the beginning of the program.

## Challenge 2 - Print a Pattern⚔️
Write a recursive function to print a specific pattern or sequence, like a triangle or a pyramid.

## Challenge 3 - Fibonacci Sequence ⚔️
Write a recursive function to generate the ``nth`` Fibonacci number.

_**The Fibonacci sequence**_ is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with ``0`` and ``1``. 

The sequence goes like this: ``0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...`` and so on. 

The mathematical formula for the Fibonacci sequence is:

``F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)``

where:
- ``F(n)`` is the ``nth`` Fibonacci number,
- ``F(n-1)`` is the previous Fibonacci number,
- ``F(n-2)`` is the Fibonacci number before that.

So, to find the next number in the sequence, you simply add the two previous numbers.

The [Fibonacci](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Fibonacci-sequence) sequence appears in many areas of mathematics and nature, from the arrangement of leaves on a stem to the branching of trees and the arrangement of seeds in a sunflower.

It's a fascinating sequence with numerous applications in computer science, mathematics, and beyond.
