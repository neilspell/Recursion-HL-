# Recursion Problem Sets üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª
The following challenges are designed to test your understanding of recursion and feature in many exams and programming interviews.
They cover a range of difficulties and scenarios, from basic recursion concepts to more advanced applications.

Starting with simpler problems and gradually increasing the complexity can help you to grasp the concept of recursion effectively. 

## Challenge 1 - Countdown ‚öîÔ∏è
Write a function that counts down from a certain number `n` to `0`. 
- Instead of using a loop like a ``for`` or ``while`` loop, you must use **recursion.**
- Prompt the user to enter a number at the beginning of the program.

## Challenge 2 - Print a Pattern‚öîÔ∏è
Write a recursive function to print a specific pattern or sequence, like a triangle or a pyramid.

Example output:
````
*
**
***
****
*****
````
Starter Code:
````py
# This code is incomplete, but may help you to get started.

def draw_triangle(n):
  if n ____:
    draw_triangle(____)    # Draw the upper part of the triangle
    print("*")             # Print the current row

# Call the function

````
#### üí°Note:  Remeber how the call stack is built up & how it then unwinds!

## Challenge 3 - Fibonacci Sequence ‚öîÔ∏è
Write a recursive function to generate the ``nth`` Fibonacci number.

_**The Fibonacci sequence**_ is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with ``0`` and ``1``. 

The sequence goes like this: ``0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...`` and so on. 

The mathematical formula for the Fibonacci sequence is:

``F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)``

where:
- ``F(n)`` is the ``nth`` Fibonacci number,
- ``F(n-1)`` is the previous Fibonacci number,
- ``F(n-2)`` is the Fibonacci number before that.

So, to find the next number in the sequence, you simply add the two previous numbers.

The [Fibonacci](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Fibonacci-sequence) sequence appears in many areas of mathematics and nature, from the arrangement of leaves on a stem to the branching of trees and the arrangement of seeds in a sunflower.

It's a fascinating sequence with numerous applications in computer science, mathematics, and beyond.

## Challenge 4 - Towers of Hanoi ‚öîÔ∏è
This is a classic problem in **recursion** where you have **three pegs** and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any peg. 

The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one peg, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another peg, obeying the following simple rules:
   - Only **one** disk can be moved at a time.
   - Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.
   - No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
