# Factorial Functions üìö

We are going to explore Factorial Functions and compare two different approaches to solving these:
1. Recursion
2. Iteration

What does factorial `!` mean? 

`5!` or _**five factorial**_ simply means multiply all the numbers from `5` down to `1`.

Example:
````
5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1
````

In Python, we can use two different methods to solve this type of problem.

### 1. Recursion - Factorial Function üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª

Let's take a look at the example given to us in the textbook:
